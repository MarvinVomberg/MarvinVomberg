- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarvinVomberg, I am 22 years old and tinker around with different technologies since I am 15
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full Stack Web Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang and Svelte and different js/php CMS Solutions
- ðŸ“« TBA

I am eager to learn new frameworks and web languages.
My favourite tech stack is VILT (Vue.js, Inertia.js, Laravel and Tailwind CSS)
I love building clean and DX friendly backends with state of the art standards.

I worked with Pimcore as a framework for a long time in my job.
Currently working with Directus as a headless CMS with Vue.js SPAs

All projects are running in a docker environment when possible.
I really want to learn more about k8s but had no real usecase yet.

For smaller parts that need to be reactive I also use Alpine.js.
Since I like the idea behind svelte, I am tinkering around with it for some while now and want to test it in a real project.

Since I enjoy working on clean APIs, I want to learn Golang to write even more efficient microservices.
