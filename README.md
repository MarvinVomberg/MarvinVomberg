- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarvinVomberg, I am 25 years old and tinker around with different technologies since I am 15
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full Stack Web Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang
- ðŸ“« TBA

I am eager to learn new frameworks and web languages.
My favourite tech stack is VILT (Vue.js, Inertia.js, Laravel and Tailwind CSS)
I love building clean and DX friendly backends with state of the art technologies and standards.

I worked with Pimcore for a long time in my job to build custom CMS for clients.
Currently working only on backends with laravel.

All projects are running in a docker environment for development.
I really want to learn more about k8s but had no real usecase yet.

For smaller parts that need to be reactive I also use Alpine.js or petite Vue.

I want to learn Golang so I can build even more efficient APIs.
